## üöÄ **Cloud-Based Data Insights Pipeline: Simplifying Sales Analytics with AWS**

üîç **Project Overview:**

I recently completed a project titled **Cloud-Based Data Insights Pipeline**, where I leveraged **AWS services** to build an end-to-end data engineering solution. The project focuses on processing sales data to generate actionable insights, demonstrating my ability to work with cloud-native tools for data ingestion, transformation, and visualization.

---

### üí° **What I Built:**

The pipeline processes sales data stored in the cloud, transforming raw information into insightful dashboards. Here's what the project does:
1. **Data Storage**: Used **Amazon S3** to store both raw and processed data.
2. **Data Transformation**: Used **AWS Glue** for schema discovery and cleaning the data.
3. **Data Querying**: Used **Amazon Athena** to run SQL queries directly on the processed data.
4. **Data Visualization**: Built interactive dashboards with **Amazon QuickSight** to visualize trends and insights.

### üõ†Ô∏è **How It Works:**

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Uploaded a sample dataset (`sales_data.csv`) containing sales records to an S3 bucket. The dataset includes columns like Sale ID, Date, Region, Product, Quantity, and Price.

2. **Data Storage**:
   - Organized the S3 bucket into:
     - `raw-data`: Stores the original CSV file.
     - `processed-data`: Holds the cleaned and structured data after transformation.

3. **Data Transformation**:
   - Configured an **AWS Glue Crawler** to analyze and create a schema for the raw data automatically.
   - Created an **AWS Glue Job** to clean and transform the data:
     - Removed duplicates.
     - Standardized column names and formats.
     - Stored the transformed data back into the `processed-data` folder in S3.

4. **Data Querying**:
   - Used **Amazon Athena** to run SQL queries on the transformed data stored in S3.
   - Example query:
     ```sql
     SELECT Region, SUM(Quantity * Price) AS Total_Sales
     FROM processed_sales_data
     GROUP BY Region;
     ```

5. **Data Visualization**:
   - Connected **Amazon QuickSight** to Athena and created interactive dashboards that show:
     - Total sales by region.
     - Top-performing products.
     - Monthly sales trends and seasonality.

### üìä **Key Deliverables:**

- **Interactive Dashboard**:
  - Visualized sales data with key metrics, including total revenue, regional performance, and product trends.
  - Enabled business insights such as identifying top-performing regions and products.

- **Scalable Data Pipeline**:
  - A cloud-native solution that can handle larger datasets as business needs grow.

### üîß **Why It‚Äôs Relevant:**

This project is a great example of how I can:
- Design scalable **data engineering pipelines** for real-world use cases.
- Work with **AWS services** to simplify complex workflows.
- Generate meaningful insights that drive business decisions.
